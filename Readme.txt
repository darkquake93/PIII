This document should give details about the structure of the repository, how to use it and where to find things
You have been given a basic structure for your repository as a starting point
You can enhance and develop this structure.  
Any changes and additions to the structure should be documented in this readme document

Starting Repository Structure:

NetBeansProject: This is where your Net Beans Project should go

Design: This is for your design documents, especially CRC Documents. Warning: Any files that are not text documents (binary documents) will not be versioned managed well by GIT. Therefore you should restrict the amount of these. A suggestion is to restrict binary files to a UML Class diagram.

Feedback: Any comments on your progress from Module staff will be put in here

Notes: This should include any notes on the progress of the development. Including attendance sheets, plans, and general notes arising from workshop sessions. Note these should be text files, binary files don't work well with GIT.

Application: The final executable code (as a jar file), data and javadoc for your completed Application.  There is a Readme file which should include any instructions required for the Module Staff to run and use your application

Templates: Templates for documents used in the design and development process. You have been provided with the key ones. Note these should be saved as text files, binary files don't work well with GIT. The word documents that you have been given are in RTF format - which is a text format however the version managed differences are likely to not work well in GIT but the documents are required.

TestData: The test data you have been provided with for your application.  You may wish to add some of your own test data. Either for acceptance testing (eg data with errors that need to be handled by your application)

UserStories: This is where your user story documents will go - including all the test documents for the user stories. These should be text files, binary files don't work well with GIT. Some of the test document templates you have been given are in RTF format - which is a text format however the version managed differences are likely to not work well in GIT but the documents are required.
